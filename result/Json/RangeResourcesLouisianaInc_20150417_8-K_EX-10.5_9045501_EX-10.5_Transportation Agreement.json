Carrier shall not be obligated to accept Product for transportation from any Shipper or prospective shipper if such Shipper or\n         prospective shipper fails to provide the requested information to Carrier within the time periods set forth herein, or if Carrier’s review of\n         the requested information reveals that such Shipper or prospective shipper does not have the capacity to perform any financial\n         obligations that could arise from the transportation of its Product under the terms of this Tariff, including the payment of transportation\n         charges, equalization obligations, the reasonably determined value of any loss allowance, and any negative balance positions.\n    F.   Subject to the provisions of Item No. 16(G), Carrier upon notice to Shipper or prospective shipper, may require one or more of the\n         following financial assurances for the payment of all charges and costs as provided for in this Tariff, or otherwise lawfully due to Carrier\n         to be provided at the expense of such Shipper or prospective shipper:\n         i.     payment security by wire transfer in an amount equal to two and a half months of transportation charges based on Shipper’s or\n                prospective shipper’s likely actual shipments for the production month for each applicable line segment. For purposes of this\n                rule, a prospective shipper’s likely actual shipments will be based on the anticipated shipments listed in such prospective\n                shipper’s shipper application; or\n\n         ii.    a letter of credit in favor of Carrier in an amount sufficient to ensure payment of all costs and charges that could reasonably\n                accrue due to Carrier in a form and from an institution acceptable to Carrier; or\n\n         iii.   a guaranty from a guarantor acceptable to Carrier.\n    G.   In the event that Carrier reasonably determines that: (i) any Shipper’s financial condition is or has become impaired or unsatisfactory;\n         (ii) any financial assurances previously provided by Shipper no longer provide adequate security for the performance of such Shipper’s\n         obligations that could arise from the transportation of its Product under the terms of this Tariff; or (iii) Carrier otherwise determines that\n         it is necessary to obtain financial assurances from any Shipper or prospective shipper, then such Shipper or prospective shipper shall\n         provide financial assurances for the payment of the charges and costs as provided for in this Tariff or otherwise lawfully due to Carrier\n         relating to the transportation of such Shipper’s or prospective shipper’s Product by Carrier. For the purpose of this Tariff, and without\n         limiting the generality of the charges and costs lawfully due to Carrier relating to the transportation of Shipper’s Product, those charges\n         and costs shall include transportation charges, equalization obligations, any negative Shipper balance positions, and any loss\n         allowance.\n\n                                                                        12\n\n\n\n\n  Source: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, 4/17/2015\n\nFERC ICA OIL TARIFF                                                                                                                    F.E.R.C.

Any financial assurances received by Carrier in accordance with Item No. 16(F)(i) shall be retained by Carrier in a non-interest-bearing\n            escrow account until such time as Carrier determines that the Shipper or prospective shipper that provided such Financial Assurance is\n            capable of performing its financial obligations to Carrier. Within ten (10) business days of such a determination by Carrier, the Financial\n            Assurance provided in accordance with Item No. 16(F)(i) shall be returned to such Shipper or prospective shipper.\n      I.    Carrier shall have a self-executing lien on all Products delivered to Carrier to secure the payment of any and all charges that are owed to\n            Carrier. Such lien shall survive delivery of Products to Shipper. Such lien shall extend to all Products in Carrier’s possession beginning\n            with Shipper’s first receipt of transportation or other services from Carrier. The lien provided herein shall be in addition to any lien or\n            security interest provided by this Tariff, statute or applicable law. Carrier may withhold delivery to Shipper of any of Shipper’s Products\n            in its possession and exercise any other rights and remedies granted under the applicable tariffs or existing under applicable law until all\n            such charges have been paid as provided above.\n\n      J.    If Shipper fails to pay an invoice by the due date, Carrier will notify Shipper of the failure, and if Shipper has not remedied the failure\n            within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice from Carrier, in addition to any other remedies under this Tariff or under applicable law,\n            Carrier shall have the right, either directly or through an agent, to sell any Products of such Shipper in Carrier’s custody at public\n            auction, on any day not a legal holiday, not less than forty-eight (48) hours after publication of notice of such sale in a daily newspaper\n            of general circulation published in the town, city, or general area where the sale is to be held, stating the time and place of sale and the\n            quantity and location of the Products to be sold. At said sale, Carrier shall have the right to bid, and, if it is the highest bidder, to\n            become the purchaser. The proceeds of any sale shall be applied in the following order: (1) To the reasonable expenses of holding,\n            preparing for sale, selling, and to the extent allowed by law, reasonable attorney’s fees and legal expenses incurred by Carrier; and (2) To\n            the satisfaction of Shipper’s indebtedness including interest herein provided from the date payment is due. The balance of the proceeds\n            of the sale remaining, if any, shall be paid to Shipper or, if there is a dispute or claim as to entitlement, held for whoever may be lawfully\n            entitled thereto. Carrier will have a claim for and against Shipper with respect to any deficiency arising from the debt due to Carrier from\n            Shipper and the proceeds of any sale after reduction as set forth above."
